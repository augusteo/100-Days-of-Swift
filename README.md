# 100-Days-of-Swift
This started when I read this post: [100 Days of Swift](https://medium.com/@samvlu/100-days-of-swift-736d45a19b63) by [samvlu](http://samvlu.com/)

I liked that. And since he already laid down the roadmap, I'm just gonna follow it, with a twist.

Instead of recoding everything from group up, which is what I presumed he did, I will try to make use of existing libraries if possible.

BDD will be used thoroughly for practice, which I am quite lacking.

The codes will be as short as possible, while still maintaining readability.

####Summary

1. Goal - to replicate the app that samvlu did, based on the text and images that he posted on his blog

2. Use open source libraries, BDD and playing code golf
